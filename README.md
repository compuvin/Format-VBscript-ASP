# Format-VBscript-ASP
Format function for VBscript or ASP. Formats dates, times, and numbers.
<br><br>
There are a bunch of format functions out there but this one is mine. I've tried a bunch and none of them did everything that I needed. Hope you find this useful.
<br><br>
Here are some use cases:<br>
Date - Format("1/3/2019", "MM/DD/YYYY") = O1/03/2019<br>
Time - Format("14:34", "H:MM AM/PM") = 2:34 PM<br>
Number - Format("123.45", "NNNN.N") = 0123.4<br>
<br>
It can be used in any combination of the items listed above. It can also be used in a VBScript as well as in a ASP website.
